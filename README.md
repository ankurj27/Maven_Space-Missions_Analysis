# Maven_Space-Missions_Analysis
🚀 Space Missions Exploration (1957–2022)
A Data Analytics Project using Power BI, DAX & Real-World Space Mission Data

This project explores 65 years of global space missions through data — uncovering trends, patterns, and performance insights across rockets, countries, and decades. Using the dataset from the Maven Analytics Space Challenge, I analyzed over 4,000+ recorded missions launched by NASA, USSR/Russia, SpaceX, ISRO, Blue Origin, China, and other agencies.

The goal: to understand how space exploration evolved, which rockets defined success, and which eras shaped today’s breakthroughs.

🛰 Project Overview

Space exploration is a story of innovation, risk, and persistence.
Every mission — successful or failed — moved humanity one step closer to our cosmic ambitions.

This dashboard helps answer:

Which countries launched the most missions?

Which rockets performed best?

How did mission success rates evolve across decades?

How have costs and efficiencies changed over time?

📊 Key Insights
🛰 Mission Performance

4,000+ missions analyzed between 1957 and 2022.

Global success rates increased steadily, showcasing advancements in engineering and precision.

1970s were the golden era — highest number of launches and strong success performance.

Mission efficiency improved despite rising costs, with lower cost-per-success ratios.

USA & USSR/Russia dominated early mission counts, while China and India have significantly accelerated in recent decades.

🚀 Rocket Performance

Modern active rockets deliver 85–90% success rates, signaling exceptional reliability.

Reusable rockets (e.g., SpaceX Falcon series) revolutionized cost and performance efficiency.

Rocket costs vary widely but demonstrate consistent optimization in the last decade.

Iterative design has helped top-performing rockets maintain long-term mission success.

🔭 Highlight Findings

Most Successful Rocket (All-Time): Cosmos-3M (11K65M) — 419 successful missions (retired).

Top Active Rocket: Falcon 9 Block 5 — 111 successful missions to date.

Golden Era of Space Exploration: 1970s–1980s saw maximum mission volume and steady success rates.

Mission Leadership: USA leads in launches, while Russia holds one of the strongest performance records.
