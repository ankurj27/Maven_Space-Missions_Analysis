🚀 Exploring 65 Years of Space Missions: A Data Story (1957–2022)
The story of space missions isn’t just about rockets — it’s about human persistence, scientific progress, and curiosity.
Every mission, successful or failed, paved the path for today’s new era of space exploration. 🌠

Thrilled to share my latest project from the Maven Analytics Space Challenge! 🛰️
Using real-world data, I explored which rockets, countries, and decades truly defined the journey of space exploration, covering global space missions spanning launches by organizations like NASA, USSR, SpaceX, Blue Origin, ISRO, and others. Here’s what the data reveals 👇

🛰 Mission Performance
🌍 Over 4,000+ missions have been recorded across decades of exploration.
📈 The success rate has steadily risen, showing how technology and precision have improved.
🕰 The 1970s emerged as the golden era of space, with record-high launch frequencies and success percentages — fuelled by private companies entering the race.
💸 Despite rising costs, mission efficiency improved, with better outcomes achieved at lower cost-per-success ratios.
🌐 The Russia (USSR) and USA led the early race, but recent years show new contenders like India and China rapidly growing their footprints.

🚀 Rocket Performance
🧠 Modern rockets show remarkable reliability — Active rockets boast an average success rate above 85–90%.
🧩 Reusable rocket programs (like SpaceX’s Falcon series) have redefined performance and cost efficiency.
💰 Rocket costs varied widely by organization and technology — yet data trends show consistent cost optimization in the last decade.
🏆 Top-performing rockets consistently delivered successful missions and are still active, reflecting how iterative design improved outcomes.

🔭 Key Insights
 🚀 The Ultimate Rocket Champion: Cosmos-3M (11K65M) with 419 successful missions. However this rocket is currently retired. In Active rockets, Falcon 9 Block 5 is the Top Performer having 111 successful missions.
🪐 The Golden Era of Space Exploration: The 1970s–1980s emerged as the golden decades, showcasing the highest mission volumes and consistent success rates.
🌍 The Winning Team: The USA dominated in total missions, while the Russia maintained exceptional success rates — demonstrating their long-term leadership in the space race.
